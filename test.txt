A semi-viral Facebook post from a Pennsylvania police department has become the latest example of an exhausting Halloween tradition: the spread of super-scary, but largely unfounded — warnings about poisoned Halloween candy.

This time, the police in Johnstown, Pa., warned people that “drug laced edibles are package [sic] like regular candy and may be hard to distinguish from the real candy” and urged parents to check their kid’s hauls for edibles containing THC. Even though the post doesn’t say that police believe anyone actually intended to hand out candy like this to kids (the department told Rolling Stone that it never made that assumption), the Facebook post was picked up by a wave of local news outlets, then national ones, which echoed the department’s warning to parents about the threat of bad strangers who wanted to give your kids THC.
